                Once a salmon spawns you can say <span class="code">!splat [salmon_name]</span>, depending on the health of the salmon you may need to splat it multiple times. <br> It is possible for you to miss, this has no downside, so simply attempt again!

                They also will have a chance to give you golden eggs, using golden eggs you can purchase items in the shop

            <div class="text">
                The Salmonmeter works slightly differently in this bot compared to the game, however it serves the same purpose. In this bot the meter is based on how many salmon have been splatted within the server, and once the meter hits 100%, a king salmon will spawn

                King Salmon
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                King salmon are extremely rare, requiring for the salmon meter to be full before they can spawn. Once they do they will require a significant amount of damage in order to splat them <br>
                Once splatted they will drop scales, these are distributed between all players that participated. The more damage the user has done the more likely it is for them to receive a scale.

                Once you splat a king salmon you get scales, currently these have no use, but are planed to in the future.
